# Credits
This Theme was created using html5blank (an open source theme) as a basis.  http://html5blank.com/.  The category image selection feature is based on a plugin called WP Custom Category Image.  https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcustom-category-image/.  Both of these sources are included in this repository (see ./sources/).
